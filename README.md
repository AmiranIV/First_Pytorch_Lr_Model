# First PyTorch Model (Linear Regression)
Preview:
I worked with other ML/Deep Learning libraries, Scikit, TensorFlow, and I wanted to learn Pytorch because it has more flexibility and control over the model building process.
PyTorch is a deep learning framework that allows you to create and customize your neural network models in more depth.
So I did this practice project in #Beginner Level# and there will be more advanced projects in the future.


First PyTorch Linear Regression model, with explanations and visualizations.

Requirements:
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch
- Numpy
(I thought I'd work with Pandas and Seaborn and didn't use them in the end.)
